        message="This folder configuration (`v24`) is unnecessary; `minSdkVersion` is 24. Merge all the resources in this folder into `drawable`."
        category="Performance"

        summary="Obsolete SDK_INT Version Check"
        explanation="This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the `minSdkVersion` (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high as the version checked for.&#xA;&#xA;Similarly, it also looks for resources in `-vNN` folders, such as `values-v14` where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the `minSdkVersion`, where the contents should be merged into the best folder.">

        id="Overdraw"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Possible overdraw: Root element paints background `@color/primary_orange` with a theme that also paints a background (inferred theme is `@style/Theme.MyCatCollections`)"
        category="Performance"
        priority="3"
        summary="Overdraw: Painting regions more than once"
        explanation="If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme background will be painted first, only to have your custom background completely cover it; this is called &quot;overdraw&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it&apos;s currently doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.&#xA;&#xA;If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.&#xA;&#xA;Of course it&apos;s possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead."

        explanation="If `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` are both in your manifest, you must either remove the reference to `android:roundIcon` if it is not needed; or, supply the monochrome icon in the drawable defined by the `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` attribute.&#xA;&#xA;For example, if `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` are both in the manifest, a launcher might choose to use `android:roundIcon` over `android:icon` to display the adaptive app icon.
